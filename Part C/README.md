Part C of the Assignment 2 is to use the YoloV3 model for a novel application.  

We have used YoloV3 to detect hand gestures for numbers 1 to 5. We tried this as proof of concept for recognizing the sign language.  

As hand gestures are one of the methods used in sign language for non-verbal communication. It is mostly used by dumb or deaf & dumb people who have speech problems to communicate among themselves or with normal people. Hence, we used YoloV3 to detect hand gestures for numbers. We can use this kind of application to help deaf and dumb people to communicate more effectively with each other or normal people. 

With this kind of application, Normal people donâ€™t need to know sign language to understand our differently-abled friends who can't use the normal way of communication and deaf & dumb people can communicate their feelings with normal people. With this kind of applications, the differences between normal and differently-abled people will be reduced by a huge margin.
